**DevOps Engineer @ UK Ministry of Justice** | FinOps & Cloud Governance Specialist

I build infrastructure tooling that prevents costly mistakes at scale—creating organizational leverage through systematic problem-solving and force-multiplying automation.

## Impact

💰 **£108,069 annual AWS savings** - Systematic EBS optimization methodology adopted by 3+ teams  
� **Prevented six-figure data loss** - Resolved 18-day disaster recovery crisis through systematic diagnosis  
��️ **Official MoJ maintainer** - [terraform-tag-validator](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/terraform-tag-validator) enforcing tag compliance at scale  
📊 **8 government departments** - Leading FinOps initiatives across UK public sector

## Featured Work

### [Terraform Tag Validator](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/terraform-tag-validator)
**Official MoJ Infrastructure Tooling** | Python, Docker, GitHub Actions

Pre-deployment tag compliance enforcement preventing cost attribution gaps across AWS infrastructure. Validates 25+ resource types with configurable YAML rules, posts detailed PR feedback with exact violations.

**Original author** - Now maintained as official Ministry of Justice tooling, currently being evaluated for organization-wide adoption to meet 2026 OKR: 100% tag compliance.

### Cost Optimization Methodologies
- **[EBS Optimization Framework](https://github.com/olu-folarin/aws-ebs-optimization-methodology-)** - 7-step verification delivering £108K savings
- **[DR Systematic Diagnosis](https://github.com/olu-folarin/disaster-recovery-systematic-diagnosis)** - Root cause analysis framework for critical incidents

## Technical Expertise

**Cloud:** AWS (EC2, EBS, RDS, S3, IAM, EKS) • Terraform • Kubernetes  
**Platform:** GitHub Actions • Policy-as-Code (OPA, Checkov, tfsec) • CI/CD  
**Languages:** Python (Boto3) • Go • Bash  
**Focus:** FinOps • Cloud Governance • Cost Attribution • Security Compliance

## Approach

I solve organizational problems, not just technical tasks:
1. **Identify systematic gaps** - Manual processes that don't scale
2. **Build automated solutions** - Tooling that enforces best practices
3. **Enable adoption** - Optimize developer experience for minimal friction
4. **Measure impact** - £ saved, risks prevented, time recovered
