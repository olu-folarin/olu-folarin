  - Organization variant: [ministryofjustice/terraform-tag-validator](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/terraform-tag-validator) (maintainer)

**Methodologies & Frameworks**
- **[aws-ebs-optimization-methodology](https://github.com/olu-folarin/aws-ebs-optimization-methodology)** - 7-step verification framework for safe EBS cleanup (£108K+ proven savings)
- **[disaster-recovery-systematic-diagnosis](https://github.com/olu-folarin/disaster-recovery-systematic-diagnosis)** - Root cause analysis framework for DR failures

**Contributions**
- **[ministryofjustice/terraform-tag-validator](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/terraform-tag-validator)** (Maintainer) - Official MoJ infrastructure tooling
- **[ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-infrastructure](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-infrastructure)** - Platform automation contributions

## Recent Achievements

**Cost Optimization**
- £108,069 annual savings: 732 EBS volumes (50.9TB) systematically optimized
- Created 7-step verification methodology preventing false positives
- Methodology adopted by Modernisation Platform and other teams
- Estimated £50-100K additional organizational savings from methodology reuse

**Infrastructure Reliability**
- Resolved 18-day Velero backup failure (127 consecutive failures)
- Day-by-day systematic diagnosis preventing six-figure data loss
- Implemented proactive monitoring (70% warning, 85% critical thresholds)

**Security Architecture**
- Architected secure RDS logs pipeline (S3+SQS) serving 1000+ namespaces
- Cross-account IAM roles with External ID pattern
- 2,698+ messages processed with metadata preservation
- Senior security leadership requested architecture presentation

**Risk Management**
- Prevented £100K+ production incident by validating "orphaned" ENIs with AWS
- Discovered resources were intentionally reserved for OpenSearch blue/green deployments
- Integrity over activity: chose thoroughness despite pressure to delete quickly

## Approach

**"90% research, 10% execution"** - Systematic validation prevents expensive mistakes:
- Velero crisis: Day-by-day memory analysis identified root cause (PV growth correlation)
- ENI investigation: AWS validation prevented six-figure production outage
- EBS optimization: 7-step verification enabled confident deletion (zero false positives)

**Force multiplication focus:**
- Don't just solve problems - create reusable methodologies
- Document for organizational learning and knowledge transfer
- Build tooling that scales beyond individual contribution
