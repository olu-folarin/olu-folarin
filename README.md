# Folarin Oyenuga

**Platform Engineer | FinOps & Cloud Infrastructure Specialist**

I build infrastructure tooling that prevents costly mistakes at scale—creating organizational leverage through systematic problem-solving and force-multiplying automation.

## Impact

💰 **£108K+ annual savings** - Systematic EBS optimization methodology with cross-team adoption  
🚨 **Prevented six-figure data loss** - Resolved 18-day disaster recovery crisis through systematic diagnosis  
🛡️ **terraform-tag-validator maintainer** - Tag compliance enforcement for large-scale infrastructure  
📊 **Cross-department impact** - Supporting FinOps initiatives across multiple teams in UK government

## Featured Work

### Terraform Tag Validator
**Tag Enforcement GitHub Action** | Python, Docker, GitHub Actions

Pre-deployment tag compliance enforcement preventing cost attribution gaps across AWS infrastructure. Validates 25+ resource types with configurable YAML rules, posts detailed PR feedback with exact violations.

Built for enterprise-scale infrastructure governance. Currently being evaluated alongside Checkov, OPA, and tfsec for organization-wide tag compliance initiatives.

### Cost Optimization Methodologies
* **EBS Optimization Framework** - 7-step verification methodology for large-scale storage optimization
* **DR Systematic Diagnosis** - Root cause analysis framework for critical incidents

## Technical Expertise

**Cloud:** AWS (EC2, EBS, RDS, S3, IAM, EKS) • Terraform • Kubernetes  
**Platform:** GitHub Actions • Policy-as-Code (OPA, Checkov, tfsec) • CI/CD  
**Languages:** Python (Boto3) • Go • Bash  
**Focus:** FinOps • Cloud Governance • Cost Attribution • Security Compliance

## Approach

I solve organizational problems, not just technical tasks:

1. **Identify systematic gaps** - Manual processes that don't scale
2. **Build automated solutions** - Tooling that enforces best practices
3. **Enable adoption** - Optimize developer experience for minimal friction
4. **Measure impact** - £ saved, risks prevented, time recovered
